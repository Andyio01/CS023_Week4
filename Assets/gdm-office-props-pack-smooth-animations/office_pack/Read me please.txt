Thanks for buying the office props pack! This deserve a toast with coffee!

Any animation with 5 frames or less in this pack was meant to be played at a low speed, 
something like 3 - 5 frames per second max.

The smooth animations, like the chair and the copy machine ones are meant to be played at high speeds,
like 10-15 frames per second!

The items that goes into the table can be arranged anyway you want, just be careful to not break perspective.

Last but not least, the watter dispenser is not in the same perspective and size, so it dosent fit with the rest of the props, but i decide to include it as a bonus if you have any 2d plataformer where it can go well!

Thx again, have a good and productive gamedev journey! ;P
